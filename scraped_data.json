Just wanted to share a quick update on my side project, [Buildform.ai](https://buildform.ai/) \\- a modern form builder we built as an alternative to Typeform, focused on conversion-first forms, smart logic, and AI-powered workflows.\n\nWe did it the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù way. Instead of launching early and iterating, I spent months obsessing over getting everything *right* ‚Äî bug-free, fast, production-ready. Honestly, I was shit scared it might flop. But turns out, people really appreciate a forms app they can rely on.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n* **AI Form Builder**: Just type what you want and boom, form done\n* **Partial Submissions** \\+ Analytics: See drop-offs, optimize based on data\n* **Logic Editor** that actually works\n* **AI Logics Builder** (coming soon): No more tangled logic flows, it writes them for you\n* **DeepOptimize** (coming soon): AI that auto-fixes your forms for better conversion\n\nWe‚Äôre at $18K in revenue and over 8,000 users now. Still early, but the feedback has been incredible. If you‚Äôre building forms for lead gen, customer onboarding, or internal tools, would love for you to try it out or tear it apart.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or feedback. Always happy to trade notes with other builders!"

        "body": "Hey, I'm [Morgan](https://x.com/m_0_r_g_a_n_). Here is [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1e5tlnh/what_i_learned_from_4_web_apps_i_built_for_the/),[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1e5tlnh/what_i_learned_from_4_web_apps_i_built_for_the/)where I described how it's tough to build side projects. But today, I want to share what I learned from building so many projects in the past years, including how you can build your products faster and save money.\n\n# DESIGN DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE\n\nIn 2024, you will definitely use everything possible to speed up your development. Nowadays, there are so many good frameworks, templates, boilerplates, and assets that it's almost impossible to make a bad design that will affect your sales or marketing. Don't go pixel-perfect \\[no one cares\\]; don't spend days and weeks picking a page layout or button color. It just makes no sense. You, one person, it's **NOT POSSIBLE TO HANDLE EVERYTHING BY ONE PERSON**, period.  Focus on how you can deliver MVP ASAP and get your first real feedback, then iterate.\n\n# BUILD MVP ASAP\n\nDevelopment doesn't matter anymore as well cuz AI has arrived. Almost anyone can build an MVP, maybe not like you, in a few days, but they can do it in a week or two.\n\nBelieve me, you will have plenty of time after the launch to add more features, change your copy, change your design, etc. It rarely happens that you launch, and the next day, you have 10K users. Early launch and early feedback will give you the exact direction that you need to work next. Complaining users or feature requests will give you the drive to work on the project after weeks and months of silent development.\n\n**How do you build MVP fast, you may ask? I'm glad you asked!**\n\n1. Use the tech stack you know the best. It makes no sense to learn something completely new if it's doing the same thing or because it's a trendy framework.\n2. Pick one main feature to start with and build it. Don't try to build the whole set of features from the start! You need more traffic, not more features!\n3. Use everything you can: boilerplates, templates, AI, and frameworks. Your product, feature set, design, and everything will be so different in a year of active development that the initial app itself will no longer matter. **YOU CAN REBUILD IT LATER IF NEEDED** \\[never happen üòÅ\\]\n4. Use third-party apps as much as possible: RESEND, Vercel, AWS, OpenAI, or whatever you need. It's much cheaper to pay $20/month than to spend 100 hours building a copy of that functionality yourself if you could buy it. **IF YOU CAN BUILD SOMETHING, IT DOES MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD.**\n5. There are a lot of free/open-source alternatives out there that could speed up your development!\n\n# CONTENT STILL THE KING\n\nCopy on your landing page, and your message are still much more valuable than design \\[until you sell design services, lol üòÇ\\]. Spend some time on a good copy, use ChatGPT, use freelancers, and get feedback from friends. But again, make your first copy, get some traffic, get feedback, and adjust your texts based on the feedback. You can create landing pages per feature, blog posts, knowledge bases, help centers, etc.\n\nIf you do PPC, focus on landing copy first. If SEO is your goal, it's a long-term game that takes time \\[weeks and months\\]. You can start with low-comp keywords, free tools, and blog posts \\[how-to's, Best X for Y, N Alternatives to, etc.\\].\n\n# TRY TO GET FREE CREDITS\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities to get free credits.\n\n1. Apply to [https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/](https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/)  to get $2500 free credits for OpenAI, $150K in Azure credits, and many more.\n2. Apply to AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/startups) via some partners ([https://founderpass.com/)](https://founderpass.com/) and get $5000 in credits. Founder Pass has many more partners with free credits, such as Cloudflare and Google Cloud.\n3. Intercom, Crisp, and others have free or almost free plans for the first year of paid membership.\n\nAnd many, many more. As you are on a tight budget, all those free credits will help you a lot!\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nDon't spend too much time on MVP because you will burn out without users' feedback, and it just makes no sense to build something into the void. Save as much as possible, try to get free credits or use open-source. Buy services if you see that you can save and speed up.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\nP.S. If you have any questions I will be glad to answer here in the comments or in DM. AMA."

I used a tool called https://fantail.ai which connected to my Google\nConsole and wrote a blog everyday on autopilot based on what my site was ranking for.

        "body": "Hey fellow devs and parents,\n\nWe managed to keep our son completely screen-free for his first two years‚Äîno TV, no phones, no YouTube. As he got older, we gradually introduced some carefully chosen videos: slow-paced documentaries, classical music performances, and older, calm animations with meaningful storytelling. But even with strict supervision, YouTube itself became a problem.\n\nEven when I chose the video myself, the homepage and recommendations bombarded him with flashy, hyper-stimulating thumbnails. Something I didn‚Äôt want him to see. And YouTube Kids wasn‚Äôt an option (not available in our country), but honestly, YouTube Kids and other similar apps are algorithm-first platforms, filled with overstimulation, and not designed for calm, intentional viewing.\n\nI wanted an app that starts from¬†**zero content**, and only shows what I explicitly added.\n\nSo I built¬†[**GoodTube**](https://goodtube.io/)¬†‚Äî a lightweight, YouTube-style app with a single goal:¬†**total control over what‚Äôs watchable**.\n\n# What Makes It Different\n\n‚úÖ No recommendations or ‚ÄúUp next‚Äù autoplay  \n‚úÖ No YouTube links or external redirects  \n‚úÖ No thumbnails designed to bait clicks (unless you yourself add that type of content)  \n‚úÖ Just your approved YouTube videos, playlists, and channels\n\n‚úÖ Available as PWA for app like experience\n\nYou go to the Add page, paste a link to any YouTube video, playlist, or channel, and it appears in your own curated ‚ÄúMy Feed.‚Äù\n\nI also built a small blog section where I write short posts about YouTube hidden gems‚Äîbeautiful lullabies, gentle music, slow nature docs‚Äîthings that are truly worth watching and co-viewing with your child. For example, you might read aloud to your kid a quick story about an obscure Scandinavian lullaby and then watch a peaceful performance of it. It‚Äôs designed to be a slow, mindful experience.\n\n# How It Works With My Son\n\nMy son is now a little over three. When he asks to watch something, I open GoodTube, and he scrolls through a calm, minimal interface. No cartoons by default. Sometimes he picks a music video or documentary. Often, he gets bored within a few minutes and moves on to play with his grandma or paint. That‚Äôs a¬†**huge win**¬†for us. I believe this setup might work well until kids are about 5, when they actively seek stimulation.\n\nSome other users have mentioned it also helps them detox from YouTube as adults‚Äîfor example, to watch yoga or meditation playlists without algorithmic distractions.\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n* **Frontend**: Next.js + React\n* **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore)\n* **Hosting**: Vercel\n* Public pages (blog, homepage) are statically generated. User feeds and features are client-rendered for simplicity.\n\n# Why I Built It\n\nGoodTube isn‚Äôt meant to compete with YouTube or become another platform. It‚Äôs the opposite‚Äîit‚Äôs meant to¬†**decrease screen time**, not extend it. If your child gets bored and walks away, that‚Äôs a feature, not a flaw. It‚Äôs not supposed to be convenient, addictive, or ‚Äústicky.‚Äù Your kids watches a video, that‚Äôs it, no auto play, you either close it or specifically navigate to another video. Done.\n\nI‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, or to hear from others trying to manage screen habits for their kids. This started as a personal tool, but if it helps even a few other families, I would like to spread it.\n\nCheck it out:¬†[https://goodtube.io](https://goodtube.io/)\n\nLet me know what you think.

        "body": "So, the last two months have been pretty wild!\n\nOn 21 February I saw that u/rosiutza had posted a prototype of a website to help people discover European products on r/buyfromeu , so I shot her a message. Today we are working with over 60 volunteers, are getting 10-20K visitors a day, and have manually verified over 2000 product recommendations.   \n  \nSo far, we've been featured in over 30 newspapers all over Europe, and we are currently getting emails from publications in Japan and Korea!\n\n**What are we doing?**  \nGo European is a platform that helps you discover European products and services. We have a bunch of filters that help you search by category, country, or non-European products that you are looking for an alternative to. The search bar is pretty powerful too, helping you search by brand names (e.g. PUMA), subcategory (e.g. toothpaste, socks), country, or products you are looking for an alternative to (e.g. Google Meet).   \n  \nUnfortunately, it doesn't allow for multiple keywords that are not connected. Every product card links to its own product page and to the product website as well.\n\n**Why did it take off like that?**  \nHonestly, the response has been amazing and overwhelming. I think our project has gotten so far in so little time because we were at the right place at the right time, and had a super fast-growing community behind us ( r/buyfromeu ) to keep up momentum as we were working on it. A few months earlier, we wouldn't have made the same waves I am sure, but given recent political developments, there is a lot more openness to and interest in European products than there used to be.\n\n**So are you boycotting US products?**  \nNo, we are all about promoting European products and services, not disparaging products from other places. We do offer European alternatives to non-European products, simply because that's how many people look for European products. They don't search for \"European website where you can find and book other people's houses\"‚Äîthey search for \"European alternative to airbnb\".\n\n**How we built it**  \nOur website is made with the no-code tool Softr hooked up to an airtable base (not European, we know). In the background, a group of devs is working on an open source V2 (React / NextJS) that doesn't require paid 3rd party tools to work.\n\n**What are we working on now?**  \nAs I mentioned, we are working with a large community of volunteers who are doing a million different things, from developing a new website from scratch, to verifying community-submitted products, developing a social media strategy outside of reddit, partnerships etc. \n\nI am personally working a lot with the data verification team and on the temporary website. One of the things I am quite excited about is hooking up the website to databases like Good On You, which rate fashion and beauty companies on their sustainability based on over 1000 data points. I feel strongly that this project is about more than hyping up European businesses, and should help people consume consciously by giving them clear and good information.\n\n**What is it like to work with over 60 volunteers?**  \nThis is my first time co-leading a large scale community project and I am learning so much. A few years ago, I wrote an article about the open source 3D design software Blender (Dutch!) and I remember vividly how its founder Ton Roosendaal said that you cannot really steer the community. They are going to go where they want to go. \n\nThis has been very true so far, and I've learned to accept and love it. For example, we've had the same stock images that come with Softr on the website for 2 months and I hate them. Any attempt to come up with an alternative with our designers has not (yet) yielded into a result we all like, and so the images have stayed on for now.   \n  \nOn the other hand, people appear out of the blue to build python scripts to scrape information from wikipedia to enhance the quality of our database, or single-handedly verify hundreds of products which must've cost days. And that's just the data team. \n\n**What's next?**  \nWe have some exciting partnerships in the pipeline with some brands that noticed a bump in their traffic through our website.\n\nAlso, we are partnering up with BrandSnap who are building an app that lets you take photos of products to tell you where it's from and recommend European alternatives.\n\n"

Analyze the market and your competitors before committing your resources\n\nI didn't analyze the market properly. I looked at 4-5 big competitors and their features and that was it. As I kept building, I encountered more and more competition in the space, and it wasn't until the 4th month that I fully realized how crowded this space really is.\n\nTo be fair, I didn't know how to do proper research.\n\nIf I were starting over, here's what I'd do:\n\nGo to AlternativeTo\n\nSearch your top 5-6 competitors\n\nCompile all their alternatives into a table\n\nHere you go, this is your competition. It will include big names as well as small indie hackers like yourself. Study them and figure out where you fit.\n\nIf you still want to continue, move on.\n\n# 3. Select a dead domain name\n\nI was careless with my first name. At the end of 3rd month I had to bite the bullet and spend a few days to re-brand everything, and to start the SEO game from scratch.\n\nMake sure the name you're selecting is a dead name. Nothing significant should appear on Google. Make sure the social media handles for this name are available. Make sure there are no other services, especially in the same niche, that have a very similar name.\n\nBrainstorm the name with ChatGPT. Brainstorm the name with friends. It's easy to get attached and get biased toward a name. You need 3rd party view on this.\n\n# 4. Start with a Waitlist\n\nSetup simple UTM and Referral tracking.\n\nAsk for the name so later you can make the emails more personalized.\n\nBare minimum for your waitlist: target audience, feature list, \"how it works\", and FAQ.\n\nYou can start with just text. When you have something to show, put a screenshot/video there.\n\nAdd \"Welcome\" email to the waitlist. As such, you 1) warm up the mailbox and 2) you can see if any emails bounced.\n\nPromote the waitlist on reddit/linkedin/X. Best source for me was Reddit. You can promote even on subreddits which do not allow promotion, if you do it smart. I made some posts on subreddits without including a link to the waitlist, and people reached out to me via DMs asking for a link.\n\n# 5. ENGAGE WITH YOUR WAITLIST\n\nSeriously, just do it. Those people signed up. Every week you make something new, you can share it with them. Send a biweekly update on the progress.\n\nI kept silent for 2.5 months before I engaged the waitlist. And when I finally did, what happened? Crickets...\n\n# 6. Choose proven stack\n\nPut your ego aside. Seriously. Just choose what works.\n\nI spent so much time simply because my stack was not optimal. In particular, Vue and Nuxt, which I use, are great frameworks, but they lack in community.\n\n# 7. Choose an SSR framework for landing page\n\nThis one may be obvious to some, but it cost me a week separating my landing page from the app so I can get SEO benefits. Don't be me.\n\n# 8. Choose proven hosting\n\nI spent several days to relocate my backend from fly.io to render.com because fly.io turned out to be ridiculously slow.\n\n# 9. Start the SEO game early\n\nWarm up your domain authority. Spend a few days to submit your Waitlist/MVP into directories. Write/generate SEO friendly high quality articles. Optimize your landing and blog page for SEO.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to not invest a few 2-3 days into it early on unless you're still in the experimentation phase.\n\n# 10. Once your MVP is out, you will get at least a few regular users. Engage with them\n\nListen to what your users say. Engage with them. Ask how they are doing. Ask for improvement ideas. Ask for feedback. Check up on them from time to time. You first 5 users are very important. When you fully release, consider leaving them as free users. They will become your cheerleaders.\n\n# 11. Do not code. Instead, PLAN\n\nThink like an architect. Only code to validate hypotheses or prove something works, but once it does, don't rush into building the full ap. Pause. Design first.\n\nLook, these days AI writes 80% of the code. But it doesn't know your vision. If you don't plan the big picture, you'll end up refactoring endlessly.\n\nStart with your data model. Seriously, I spent weeks reworking mine. And I've had plenty of smaller refactors that could have been avoided had I put more thoughts into planning.\n\nThink. Plan. Then build.\n\n# 12. Do not waste time on UI\n\nJust accept that your MVP UI does not matter. When the time is right, you will change it anyway. Don't spend time on the UI on the first version of the app. Just make it simple and clean, but don't overdo it.\n\n# 13. Look for out of box solutions when possible\n\nI spent 5 days developing custom billing portal only to find out that Stripe provides it out of box. It took me less than 2 hours to integrate the OOB one.\n\n# 14. Simplify, simplify, simplify\n\nCan't emphasize this enough. I know this is hard. Your backlog will grow. You'll have more and more ideas. But you have to stay razor sharp. Focus on one specific problem. Whenever you can, look for short cuts.\n\n80% of time the right decision to whatever dilemma you're having is to simplify.\n\nIf this helped you ‚Äî let me know what resonated.\n\nOr tell me what you wish you knew before launching üöÄ\n\nThank you for reading."

        "body": "I built CallSky, an app for making affordable international calls to landlines and cell phones worldwide. With Skype shutting down this month, I wanted to create a simple alternative focused specifically on low-cost global calling.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* International calls starting at $0.01/minute\n* Simple pay-as-you-go credit system\n* Available on iOS (Android coming soon)\n* Calls to 180+ countries\n\n**Why I built it:** When Microsoft announced they were shutting down Skype, I realised many people and businesses would lose their go-to solution for affordable international calling. Teams doesn't fully replace this functionality, so I saw an opportunity to fill this gap.\n\n**Early traction:** I released CallSky about 9 days ago and have had around 22 sales so far, worth ¬£99 after the 15% Apple cut. Things have slowed down a bit after the initial boost that the App Store typically gives to new apps, but I'm encouraged by the early interest.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chxm2x1pzq1f1.png?width=3510&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfdcd5a076ac385a794a3e64ac3138ebfc33b56\n\n**Business model question:** I'm unsure if businesses would be interested in using this. Would offering a business subscription (perhaps $X/month for 50 employees) be viable? I'm thinking about adding an admin portal where managers could add/remove employees from the plan.\n\nI'm also trying to figure out the best way to reach businesses that might need this solution. Is LinkedIn outreach to operations managers a good approach? Or do you see this as primarily a consumer app that wouldn't appeal to corporate users? Would love insights from anyone with B2B SaaS experience.\n\nAt this point I'm stuck with the marketing and distribution, ideas welcome.\n\nThank you,"

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nEarlier this month we launched a landing page for Cabin ([https://cabin.social](https://cabin.social)), a discussion platform for digital communities. Since then, we have garnered significant interest from communities. We‚Äôre incredibly excited to launch Cabin to iOS and Android in Spring 2025, with a web experience following shortly thereafter.\n\nFor those wondering, Cabin is designed to serve as an alternative to platforms like Reddit. I have been a Redditor for over a decade and have watched as its leadership slowly degraded the experience for everyone in an effort to increase revenue. I understand capitalism‚Äìcompanies need to make money‚Äìbut we believe there are better ways to drive revenue; ways that are more friendly to the communities we serve.\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about some (not all) of the things we‚Äôre focusing on:\n\n**Disinformation**\n\nWe understand our role and responsibilities in preventing the spread of disinformation on Cabin. Our team is exploring various methods of identifying and adding clarity to content that is found to be misleading or verifiably false. This is especially important with regards to topics such as politics, health, and race.\n\nWe will likely utilize machine learning to identify disinformation, and inform users by attaching a small note to the post.\n\n**Monetization**\n\nSimilar platforms primarily utilize ads for driving revenue. We‚Äôre exploring some alternative pathways to monetization that aren‚Äôt as abrasive to our communities. The reality is that we have to make money‚Äìbuilding and maintaining digital platforms isn‚Äôt cheap. But that doesn‚Äôt mean our users should suffer.\n\nSome approaches we‚Äôve considered:\n\n* **Premium Account**: Upgrade your account for a small monthly fee to receive benefits that elevate your experience.\n* **Premium Community**: Purchase power-ups (communities would come with X number of power-ups for free) for your community or contribute a few bucks toward a power-up for a community you‚Äôre a member of; we think Discord does a reasonably good job of this.\n\nNote: We have not identified what a premium account or community looks means in terms of features, but will share that with followers as soon as we have information worth sharing.\n\n**Early access**\n\nAs mentioned above, we‚Äôre aiming to launch early access for our iOS and Android apps in Spring 2025. Early access will be closed to the public, but users will regularly receive invite codes to share with friends (or strangers).\n\nIt‚Äôs free to join the waitlist. We will never share your email address with anyone and we will never waste your time with needless emails.\n\n[https://cabin.social](https://cabin.social)\n\n**Questions or suggestions**\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions or provide feedback and suggestions.\n\nThank you!"

        "body": "I developed a better alternative to Winston, Pino, and CloudWatch for logging in Node.js. Here's why it's better:\n\n1.) Winston and Pino only capture custom logs, not standard console logs, Additionally, they don‚Äôt provide a dashboard for viewing logs, which forces you to rely on third-party services like CloudWatch.\n\n2.) CloudWatch, while useful, comes with several downsides. It‚Äôs a paid service, while Errsole is open-source and free. CloudWatch also affects the performance of your Node.js application, and setting it up is more complex compared to Errsole, which only requires adding two lines of code to your project. Furthermore, setting up alerts for critical errors in CloudWatch is tedious, and you still don‚Äôt get error context with email notifications. Errsole, on the other hand, offers a built-in dashboard where you can view, search, and filter logs. It also sends alerts via Slack or email, including error context and a direct link to the log. Plus, it's so easy to set up that even a junior developer can manage it.\n\n>[Errsole](https://github.com/errsole/errsole.js) has more features than these and it's FOSS (Free OpenSource Software)"

Spending hours trying to recreate UI components from scratch without a clear starting point.\n\nAs a developer with 8 years of experience, I often found myself browsing websites, admiring beautifully designed components, and wondering how they were built. I wished there was an easy way to take inspiration from existing designs and bring them into my own projects without having to reverse-engineer everything manually.\n\nThat realization hit hardest when I needed a custom React carousel looking like the one on Netflix for a side project. The existing libraries didn‚Äôt fit my needs, and tweaking them didn't work. The only solution? Build my own tool to generate the exact component I envisioned. It worked so well that I realized others might have the same struggle. Designers and developers who want to **turn UI inspiration into production-ready code effortlessly.**\n\nThat‚Äôs how **Design2Code** came to life.\n\nUnlike website builders that generate entire websites with rigid, often unscalable structures, **Design2Code focuses on what truly matters for developers and designers building real products‚Äîclean, reusable components.** When scaling a SaaS application, pre-built website templates fall short. You still need structured, maintainable code that integrates seamlessly into your existing stack. That is why I decided to focus on components to **bridge the gap between design and development by providing production-ready UI components** that follow best practices, making it easier to scale projects without sacrificing quality or flexibility.\n\nThe **beta** is free and available at [https://design2codeapp.com/](https://design2codeapp.com/)\n\nHope it will be useful to you and help in your endeavor! **Don't hesitate to reach out for any feedbacks or features to add.**\n\n**Wish you the best :)**"

It's like a gauntlet of occasions that I kept half-assing because of the anxiety and stress.\n\nI'd find myself at Harris Teeter (local grocery store in NC lol) at 10pm, staring at sad flowers, thinking \"I'm such a piece of shit for not planning something better.\" Not because I forgot the dates ‚Äî I just sucked at planning something meaningful in advance. For years I kept complaing to my buddy \"I wish there was an app for this\" and he finally convinced me to build it myself.\n\nHere's the thing: I have ZERO formal coding background. I spent a decade working in the fitness industry before burning out, pivoted to tech marketing, then became a stay-at-home dad for the last 3 years. But I'm obsessed with learning new things deeply and creating rapidly.\n\nSo I taught myself SwiftUI and with the help of Cursor developed this iOS app from scratch in 90 days to solve my own problem (feeling like a forgetful POS).\n\nMy iOS app is called Concero and it doesn't just remind you about dates, it creates hyper-personalized gift ideas and a step-by-step plan to execute them.\n\nFeatures:  \n‚Ä¢ AI-powered gift suggestions based on recipient's interests  \n‚Ä¢ Smart timeline with reminders for when to order/book  \n‚Ä¢ Step-by-step planning to eliminate last-minute panic  \n‚Ä¢ Completely free to use right now (on a credit system for time being)\n\nTech Stack:  \n‚Ä¢ iOS native with SwiftUI  \n‚Ä¢ Firebase for auth, database & cloud functions  \n‚Ä¢ OpenAI API integration  \n‚Ä¢ Built primarily with Cursor as my AI CTO  \n‚Ä¢ Xcode for development environment\n\nI'd love your brutal feedback to make this better - download it, try creating one plan, and tell me what sucks (or doesn't):\n\n[https://www.concero.app](https://www.concero.app)\n\nIf you're a fellow last-minute scrambler, I'd especially love to hear if it actually helps you. No sugar coating needed - the good, bad, and ugly will all make this thing better. Also, AMA =\\]\n\nMuch love ya'll,\n\nAnt\n\nP.S. The app suggested my friend would love a custom Mandalorian cooking apron + curated spice box which is something I never would of pieced together. His reaction was def pretty great: \"Yo thank you so much for my gifts! It's actually wild I was just saying that I wanted to buy an apron and how convenient it would be.\""

JavaScript, databases, Stripe integration, deployment.

Sometimes testing things out locally with ollama, barely running around with 5$ credit in each of these closed source LLMs.   \n  \nMy major problem has been switching the different Authentication methods, response formats, rate limiting. Some LLMs adjust to the prompt like \"dont include any words, always return a JSON\", but need additionally parsing to strip out characters, but some LLMs dont respect the prompt at all which is frustrating when the app is in production and you need to switch to a different LLM temporarily.\n\nSo my question is  \n  \n1. How do you switch between these LLMs without maintaining 5 different API keys? There's got to be a cleaner approach?  \n2. How are you handling multi-provider LLM integration? Any tools/patterns that make this less painful?\""

It generates a Google search query to find relevant threads.\n\nFor example, if you're exploring r/ProductManagement, you can see the most frequently asked \"What\" and \"How\" questions. If an interesting keyword pops up, like \"strategic thinking\", you can use the tool to find all related threads on that topic.\n\nInstead of building products people say \"looks interesting, but I wouldn't pay for it,\" use this to find the burning problems folks are actively struggling with right now.\n\nGive the tool a try here: https://shavinpeiries.com/reddit-search/\n\n[I've also written a detailed how-to-guide on finding valuable problems to solve using Reddit.](https://shavinpeiries.com/how-to-find-shut-up-and-take-my-money-problems-using-reddit/)\n\nLet me know what you think!"

It‚Äôs a blueprint for post-work life ‚Äî a decentralized system where AI helps coordinate meaningful human contributions, and everyone gets rewarded based on usefulness instead of job status. We're testing the foundations now, but the vision is much bigger.\n\nThis is a side project I‚Äôve been working on for a while. For the first phase, the idea is to coordinate small, useful tasks and pay people fairly for doing them ‚Äî no resume or job title needed.\n\nI wanted to test: Can you build a dignity-first alternative to work that‚Äôs lightweight, transparent, and actually helpful?\n\nThere‚Äôs a prototype running now. You sign up, get a small useful task, and get paid. Tasks are short and flexible.\n\nWould love any feedback ‚Äî on the concept, UX, trust, or anything else. I‚Äôm genuinely trying to build something people would want to use.\n\nCheck it out here: [https://forms.gle/vQcpn8Pr4xVwfLqs8](https://forms.gle/vQcpn8Pr4xVwfLqs8)  \nMore info: [https://www.notion.so/HUE-Human-Utility-Engine-1cba79a83d9d8068b783dae4702d5621?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/HUE-Human-Utility-Engine-1cba79a83d9d8068b783dae4702d5621?pvs=4)\n\nPS: If you're excited by the bigger vision and want to support it, donation info is also available there.\n\n**EDIT (April 6):**  \nWe received 39 signups and have closed the form to stay within our $150 Phase 1 budget.

Because I needed a simple way to get data where I needed it, without building a huge app or waiting for something I‚Äôd have to sign up to. Plus, it‚Äôs free forever ‚Äì no hidden paywalls or limits on usage.\n\n**This is app #5** of my challenge to release 20 apps in 20 weeks with a friend and ChatGPT.

I started off with a pastebin-like tool a few months back but got really busy with other stuff (work, personal life, etc.) and never got the motivation to pick it back up.\n\nAnyways, I decided to start building an alternative to Disqus. I don't intend to make money off of it. The biggest motivation for this project was so I could add comments to blog posts on my own site. Another factor was me applying a new software development pattern I recently started learning about. You might be thinking, why not use something like Disqus or another open source alternative to add comments to my site? Well it was mostly because I love building stuff, and this just has the added benefit of having created my website's elements from scratch (even though the site's style is HEAVILY inspired from some nice sites I found online).\n\nWith that being said, I wanted to know if anyone here has had any issues when adding a commenting feature on any of your projects. Even if you did, I would love to hear your thoughts!\n\n* What was the thing/s that you liked the most?\n* What was the thing/s that caused \"friction\"?\n* Is being open source and able to self-host a big factor for you guys?\n* Any things you wish you could do, but couldn't with the already existent solutions?\n\nI'm asking these questions just so I have more things to add to this project of mine other than just a way to store, manage and show comments. This is not to rope in users and money (although I would love to if it makes sense later on), but to solidify my skills as a dev.\n\nI don't have a name for it yet, but that's the least important thing for me right now lol. \n\nThank you so much for your time!"
